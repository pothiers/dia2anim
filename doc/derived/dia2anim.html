>The <A

>Dia</A

    editor is used to create a schematic of a scene.
    The schematic represents static (non-moving) and dynamic (moving) objects.
    In general Dia graphic objects will become static objects in the
    animation.  The exception is when two Dia graphic objects are connected by
    a line.  A connecting line indicates that the two endpoint graphics
    represent <SPAN

>multiple observations</I
></SPAN
> of the SAME physical
    object.</P
><P
>Layers are used within Dia to simplify creating many animations with
    the same static objects in them. For instance, I created a background
    layer of static objects representing a traffic intersection (including
    objects such as: medians, lane markings, sidewalks, crosswalks, and
    buildings on the corners).
